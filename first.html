BARBUS Brabus GmbH (stylized in uppercase) is a German high-performance automotive aftermarket tuning company founded in 1977 in Bottrop (Ruhr area). Brabus specialises mainly in Mercedes-Benz, Maybach and Smart vehicles. They have also modified other vehicles including Porsche.

History
The company began with Bodo Buschmann wanting to customise his cars. Discovering most existing customisers could not grasp his vision or meet his requirements, he started his own brand. Brabus GmbH was registered in 1977 in West Germany with Buschmann's friend Klaus Brackmann to satisfy German law requiring a company to be established with at least two people. The company name was derived from the first three characters of the founders' surnames (Brackmann, Buschmann). Following the company's foundation, Brackmann sold his company shares to Buschmann for 100 euros.[1]

In 2012, Brabus had started building its third factory in Bottrop.[2]
